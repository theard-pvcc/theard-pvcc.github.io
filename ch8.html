                <ol>
                    <li>The first game I played was a pig pen cypher. It was easy and straigtforward to understand.
                         Each charater represented a letter, and the key gives you the ability to figure it out quite fast.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Normal game I played was a rail fence. This one was also fairly easy. It requires looking at the 
                        encryption in a snake like pattern from the top left to the bottom right.
                    </li>
                    <li>The hard game I played was a Vigenere. This one was a bit more difficult as you have to make a key stream 
                        from the key and use it to figure out what letters have been substituted for.

                    <li>My opinion of the games:</li>
                    <ul><li>Christine McCarthy is an incredibly impressive high school student. It is obvious that coding and cryptography 
                        are things she is interested in, and I thought the games and site were well designed.
                    </li></ul>
                    <li>Would I recommend:</li>
                    <ul><li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone who may be interested in cryptography.</li></ul>
                    <li>Her code:</li>
                    <ul><li>Her code is simple and clean, and again I would say it's impressive for a highschooler to come up with something 
                        like this.
